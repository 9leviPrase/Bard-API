## What is Memory Stick Drive Increaser 8gb.rar.rar14?
  
Memory Stick Drive Increaser 8gb.rar.rar14 is a software that was created by DRIVE INCREASER LLC and published on the Xiaomi Community website. It is a software that claims to increase the storage capacity of your memory stick drive from 8GB to 16GB for free by modifying the file system and partition table of your memory stick drive.
  
The software works by creating a new partition on your memory stick drive that occupies the remaining space after the original 8GB partition.

1. Select your memory stick drive from the list of drives and click Next.
2. Select FAT32 as the file system for your new partition and click Next.
