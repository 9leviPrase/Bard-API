# The Cow Plant: A Deadly Delight for Sims Fans
 
If you are a fan of The Sims series, you may have heard of the Laganaphyllis Simnovorii, or more commonly known as the Cow Plant. This bizarre bovine vegetation is large enough to swallow your next-door neighbor whole. In fact, it WILL eat your neighbors if you don't feed it regularly. But don't worry, you can also milk it for sweet, rejuvenating nectar of life that will add precious days to your Sims' lives and wash away any regret they may have over their visitor's fate.

The Cow Plant first appeared as the career reward for the Natural Science career in The Sims 2: University[^1^]. It was later made available from The Sims 3 Store as premium content in the Killer Classics set[^2^]. It also returns in The Sims 4, where it becomes a plant that must be grown from a rare seed[^3^]. The Cow Plant was also added to The Sims Social on Halloween 2011, where it was sold for 500 Social Points.
 
The Cow Plant has a unique appearance and behavior that makes it stand out from other plants in the game. It has a large green stem with four leaves, a cow-like head with horns and ears, and a long tongue that holds a slice of cake. The cake is used to lure unsuspecting Sims close to the plant, who then devours them whole. The Cow Plant can also be fed with a Leg 'O' Lamb, which costs Â§35 in The Sims 2 and Â§450 in The Sims 3. Feeding the Cow Plant will make it happy and less likely to eat Sims, while neglecting it will make it hungry and more aggressive.
 
After the Cow Plant has consumed a Sim, it will produce milk that can be harvested by clicking on it and selecting "Milk". Drinking the milk will provide the Sim with a Divine Meal moodlet that will boost their energy, fun, hunger, and bladder needs. It will also reset their age to the beginning of their current life stage. However, drinking too much milk can be fatal, as it will cause the Sim to die of old age. The milk can also be sold for Â§300 in The Sims 2 and Â§1000 in The Sims 3.
 
The Cow Plant is not only a deadly plant, but also a loyal pet. It can be interacted with by playing with it, petting it, giving it a treat, praising it or scolding it. These actions will affect its personality and behavior, making it more or less likely to eat Sims. Some Sims with certain traits will also react differently to the Cow Plant, such as being more or less tempted by the cake bait, or praising or scolding it autonomously after it has eaten someone.
 
The Cow Plant is one of the most iconic and fun objects in The Sims series. It offers a lot of gameplay possibilities and challenges for players who want to spice up their game. Whether you want to create a loving pet, a ruthless henchman, or a fountain of youth, the Cow Plant is sure to satisfy your needs.

If you want to get your own Cow Plant, you will need to do some work. In The Sims 2, you can only obtain it by reaching level 10 of the Natural Science career. In The Sims 3, you can buy it from the Store for 706 SimPoints, or get it as part of the Killer Classics set for 1,900 SimPoints. In The Sims 4, you will need to find a rare Cow Plant Berry seed and plant it in your garden. You can find the seed by fishing in certain locations, exploring space with a rocket ship, or digging for treasure.
 
Once you have planted the seed, you will need to take care of it until it grows into a full-sized Cow Plant. You will need to water it regularly and weed it occasionally. You can also talk to it or fertilize it to improve its quality. It will take about five days for the seed to sprout into a baby Cow Plant, and another five days for the baby to grow into an adult. You can tell when the Cow Plant is ready to eat by looking at its tongue. If it has a cake on it, it means it is hungry and will try to lure Sims in. If it has nothing on it, it means it is full and will not eat anyone.
 
The Cow Plant is not only a plant and a pet, but also a collectible. In The Sims 4, you can collect different types of Cow Plants by grafting different plants together. For example, if you graft a Snapdragon with a Strawberry, you will get a Dragon Fruit Cow Plant. If you graft a Lily with a Snapdragon, you will get an Orchid Cow Plant. There are 10 different types of Cow Plants in total, each with their own unique appearance and name. You can display them in your garden or in your house as trophies of your gardening skills.
