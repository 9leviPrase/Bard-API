If not, try using a different USB port or contact your computer manufacturer for assistance.

You should also see a notification on the bottom right corner of your screen saying that your device is ready to use.
 
## Step 3: Set Your Headset as Default Audio Device
 
To ensure that your audio output and input are routed through your headset, you need to set it as your default audio device. To do this, follow these steps:
 
- Right-click on the speaker icon on the bottom right corner of your screen and select **Open Sound settings**.
- Under **Output**, click on the drop-down menu and select **Logitech USB Headset**.
- Under **Input**, click on the drop-down menu and select **Logitech USB Headset**.
- Click on **Device properties** under both output and input sections and adjust the volume level according to your preference.

## Troubleshooting Tips
 
If you encounter any issues with your Logitech USB Headset H340, here are some possible solutions:

- If you don't hear any sound from your headset, make sure that it is not muted. You can check this by looking at the inline volume control on the headset cord. If there is a red line across the speaker icon, press it to unmute it.
- If you hear distorted or crackling sound from your headset, try plugging it into a different USB port or using a different computer. If the problem persists, contact Logitech support for warranty service.
- If your microphone is not working or picking up too much background noise, make sure that it is positioned correctly. The microphone should be about two finger-widths away from your mouth and aligned with it. You can also adjust the microphone sensitivity by going to **Sound settings > Input > Device properties > Levels**.
