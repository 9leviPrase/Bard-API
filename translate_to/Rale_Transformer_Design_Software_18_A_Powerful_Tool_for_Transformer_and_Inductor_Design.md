# Rale Transformer Design Software 18: A Powerful Tool for Transformer and Inductor Design
  
Transformers and inductors are essential components in many electrical and electronic applications, such as power distribution, conversion, rectification, filtering, isolation, and signal processing. Designing transformers and inductors requires a lot of knowledge, experience, and calculations to optimize the performance, efficiency, reliability, and cost of these devices.

Fortunately, there is a software that can help you with this challenging task: Rale Transformer Design Software 18. This software is the latest version of the world's best design software for power transformers and inductors, developed by RALE Switzerland. It has been used by more than 150 manufacturers of transformers and inductors around the world for over 40 years.
  
Rale Transformer Design Software 18 consists of several professional programs that can calculate and design transformers and inductors for a wide range of applications, such as:
  
- Small transformers up to 10VA, potted, short circuit proof, halogen lamp transformers, LED transformers, control transformers, universal transformers, high leakage inductance transformers, audio transformers, autotransformers, universal autotransformers, rectifier transformers with R, RL and RC load, MIX transformers (auto transformer with more secondary windings), medical transformers, battery charger transformers, welding transformers, toroidal transformers, current transformers, voltage transformers.
- AC/AC transformers, flyback transformers, forward transformers, resonance transformers, converter transformers with AC or DC output (R, RL and RC load).
- Distribution transformers with EI, UI, 3EI, 5EI and DELTA cores, 50/60Hz, max. 5MVA per leg at 50Hz.
- Inverter transformers with PWM up to 10kHz.
- K-Factor transformers.
- 2-, 4-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-pulse rectifier transformers.
- 400 Hz military transformers.
- Cooling channel transformers.
- Transformers with integrated inductor.
- Motor starting autotransformers.
- Transformers for frequency converters.
- L'Blanc transformers.
- Inducto Scott transformers.
- Rale-Scott transformers: 3Ph to 1Ph.
- Inductors with EI, UI, 3EI cores and all existing ferrite cores & bobbins.

Rale Transformer Design Software 18 can handle output power up to 5MVA per leg at 50Hz or up to 10kA per leg at any frequency up to 500kHz. It can also handle voltage up to 35kV per leg at any frequency up to 500kHz. It can support windings connections I,Y,D,Z,Dex. It can also deal with temperature up to 250Â°C. It can use cooling media air and oil (AN and AF). It can design in case (air and potted), cabinet (AN and AF inside), oil tank (AN and AF outside).
  
Rale Transformer Design Software 18 can use wires: round, rectangle,, foil and litz wires made of Al or Cu. It can use steel: GO (grain oriented), CR (cold rolled), ferrites and powders. It can use windings: max. 12 in series or parallel with or without cooling channels with max.8 discs in single section or double section construction. It can also use transposition (4 versions) to reduce eddy current losses.
  
Rale Transformer Design Software 18 can optimize the design of transformers and inductors according to various criteria such as material price (with or without optimization), load losses (with or without optimization), temperature rise (with or without optimization), short circuit voltage (with or without optimization), weight (with or without optimization), dimensions (with or without optimization), etc.
  
Rale Transformer Design Software 18 can also generate various outputs such as:

- Schematic diagram of the transformer or inductor.
- Technical data sheet of the transformer or inductor.
- Bill of materials of the transformer or inductor.
- Cost calculation of the transformer or inductor.
- Losses calculation of the transformer or inductor.
